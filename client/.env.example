## Client environment (Vite)
#
# This file is used for local web development:
#   - Copy to `client/.env`
#   - Run `pnpm dev`
#
# Notes:
# - Variables prefixed with `CLIENT_` are embedded into the frontend bundle.
# - When you change this file, restart `pnpm dev`.
#
# What to set:
# - For host dev (server runs on your machine): point to the Axum server port.
# - For deployment via `deploy/docker-compose.yml`: you typically don't use this
#   file, because the Docker build gets `CLIENT_API_BASE_URL` from `deploy/.env`.

## Base URL used by the browser to reach the API
#
# Host dev default:
#   - API direct: http://localhost:3000
#
# If you're hitting the API through the nginx reverse proxy (same-origin):
#   - http://localhost:8080
CLIENT_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
